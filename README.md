# SortAbe

I go by Abe.

I love all things programming(Java,Python,C,Bash) and pseudo programming(SQL,HTML,CSS,RegEx).

But above all I am an advance data wrangler. I pride myself in being able to pick signal from 
noise regardless of how much noise there is.

I will collaborate on anything that involves filtering and processing dat.

:wave:You can reach me at: personal@abediaz.me

I use Vim by the way.
